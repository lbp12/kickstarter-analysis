# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this project I looked at how different campaigns preformed based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By creating a table that looked at the different outcomes based on the month they were launched allows us to see what month may be best to launch a campaign. For this project I looked specifically at theater launch dates.

*Here, we see how theater campaigns perform based on the specific month it was launched.*

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I built a chart that took the different percentages of each outcome based on a series of goal ranges. This helps to look at a good goal to set and how successful or unsuccessful the campaign can be.

*This chart shows the different outcomes and how they performed based on the different goal ranges for plays*  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge that was encountered during this project was in the table for the “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date” ungrouping the dates created conversion to list months. I was able remove the larger time parameters in the rows section, such as year and quarters, this only left the months to be listed.

Another challenge was setting up all the ranges for the “Outcomes Based on Goals”. If the *countif* equation had a wrong number inputted for the range, then the data did not reflect correctly. Once all the ranges were correctly entered then the table reflected the data appropriately. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
  - One conclusion that can be made is that theater fundraising campaigns tend to perform better during March-August, peaking in May.
  - Another conclusion is that October is the most likely month that a theater campaign launch may fail. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Chart 2 shows that smaller goals tend to be more successful, while higher goals tend to fail other than a few outliers. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - A limitation that I have found in this dataset is age demographics. If we had this data we could look to see if this had any factor on the success of being able to make a fundraising goal.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - Another table we could create for this data set is to look at is the most successful type of parent campaign. We could add filters for country and even parent    categories and then look at each subcategory from there.
